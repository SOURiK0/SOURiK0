Hey there  
I'm Sourik, an MCA student based in India.  
I build whatever I decide to build. If an idea appears, I turn it into code and ship it.

I work with Python, C++, machine learning, and Linux.  
My core tools are Git, VS Code, Jupyter, and MySQL.  
I design systems, break them on purpose, rebuild them, and refine them until they’re solid.

I’ve shipped several public projects, and I’m building far more privately than I share.

Check out my pinned repositories if you want to see how I work.
